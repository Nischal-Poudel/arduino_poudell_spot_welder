<H1> Arduino Poudell Spot Welder <br>

<H2>Detailed Instructions on How to correctly build one yourself has been documented on Instructables: https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Arduino-Based-Battery-Spot-Welder/ <br>
<H2>Youtube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PPimPCcil8 </H2>



<H3> Key Highlights are:

1. Uses Arduino Pro Mini 5V 16Mhz, can compile to any Arduino AVR Boards
2. Arduino IDE can be used upload the code to Arduino Boards
3. Complete Graphical User Interface on 0.96" OLED
4. Variable Pulse duration and multi pulse supported, can be configured by rotatory encoder and GUI. 
5. Footswitch Trigger Input
6. Battery low-voltage protection. 
7. Option for multiple Current Switched
        - Primarily uses Group of Mosfets as a switch but, if you don't have power MOSFETs at your spare, Motorbike Starter relays or Car Starter relays can also be used instead of the Mosfets. <br>
        - A relay is Present, if you want to make a SPOT Welder from Hacked Microwave Transformer, It can do it as well by acting as a timing switch. <br>
